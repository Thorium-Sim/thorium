// Crew move between decks.
// A decks crew count is determined by how many crew members
// have that deck as their current location.

// Until we get node maps for rooms and decks, we'll operate
// on the following principles:

// 1. Crew members can move to any deck instantaneously. They do not
//    have to move through every deck between to get to another deck.
// 2. Crew members cannot move into a deck that is evacuated. If all
//    decks are evacuated, they will all move into deck 1 as a fallback.
// 3. Crew members cannot enter or leave a deck that has the doors closed.
// 4. Crew members will randomly move between decks infrequently
// 5. Crew members on a team will very quickly (but not instantly)
//    move to whatever deck the team is assigned to.
