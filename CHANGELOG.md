- **Sensors:** Adds a sonar ping feature to sensors, which hides contacts from
  view unless the crew sends a ping. Contacts disappear shortly after the ping
  uncovers them. It can be set up to automatically ping at a high or low
  interval, or ping by manually clicking a button. Pinging on sensors affects
  stealth. This will be enabled by default, but you can turn it off on the
  sensors system config or in the Extras tab of sensors core. Closes

- **Timeline:** Adds a new timeline step: Change Timeline Mission. This allows
  you to change what the current timeline is in the middle of a flight, or
  switch to a different step in the current mission. Activating this action
  happens by clicking on the button for the timeline you want to switch to in
  the timeline core. This feature can be used to create branching timelines,
  where based on the decisions of the crew you can jump to one timeline or to a
  different timeline. Closes

  HTTPS enables advanced features in future versions of Thorium that aren't
  possible without a secure connection.
