  "alert-level-description-1": "This alert condition is used when the ship is in danger or under attack. All crew members are put on duty at battle stations.",
  "alert-level-description-2": "This alert condition is used when the ship is in a dangerous situation, but is safe for the moment. All crew members are put on duty.",
  "alert-level-description-3": "This alert condition is used when the ship needs to be ready for a crisis. All off duty personnel are put on stand by status.",
  "alert-level-description-4": "This alert condition is used when the station has a minor problem. All crew except damage control is on standard duty.",
  "alert-level-description-5": "This alert condition is used when the ship is at normal running status. The crew is on standard duty and the ship is in no danger.",
  "computer-core-training-1": "The computer core is the brains of your ship. Controls for all of the stations on the bridge and throughout the ship are managed by the computer core. It runs a sophisticated operating system which mostly takes care of itself.",
  "computer-core-training-10": "Click on the files button now. Then choose a level to look at some files.",
  "computer-core-training-11": "Here are your files. Files usually have boring, descriptive names. Corrupt files, however, have corrupted names. They'll look wrong and unintelligable. These corrupt files will shut down terminals. Fortunately, we keep an immutable backup which you can use to restore corrupt files.",
  "computer-core-training-12": "Select a file to restore the file individually. If there are too many corrupt files, you can always restore all files for a level. This will create a clean-slate state for this level of files.",
  "computer-core-training-13": "It may seem like a lot, but this responsibility is important. Without a careful steward, the computer core could shut down entirely. Keep a close eye on users, scan for viruses, restore files, and restart terminals when necessary and, hopefully, everything will run perfectly smooth.",
  "computer-core-training-2": "However, like all software, the computer core is not perfectly engineered. It is succeptible to attacks from outside forces. Hackers and viruses can gain access to the system and cause files to become corrupt, which causes terminals to shut down. Your job is to keep the terminals running properly. If too many terminals shut down, systems on the ship could behave erratically.",
  "computer-core-training-3": "This is a list of the terminals on the ship, showing the number and the status. If a terminal is ever offline, you need to restart it. First, select the terminal you want to restart.",
  "computer-core-training-4": "Click this button to restart a terminal. It can take a couple of seconds.",
  "computer-core-training-5": "Viruses infect the computer core and cause files to become corrupted. You can easily find and remove viruses by first scanning for the viruses by clicking this button. If a virus is found, click the 'Remove Virus' button to remove it.",
  "computer-core-training-6": "You can see all of the users with access to the computer core and all of the files that make the computer core run properly. Toggle between viewing users and files with these buttons. Click on the 'Users' button now.",
  "computer-core-training-7": "Both users and files are organized into access levels, where level 1 is the highest, most privliaged level and level 10 is the lowest level. Click on a level to see the users in that level.",
  "computer-core-training-8": "The users appear in this table. You should regularly peruse the user list to make sure there aren't any unusual users on the list. That user might be a hacker. Remember, hackers create viruses which can corrupt files. Remove any hackers, and new viruses won't be created.",
  "computer-core-training-9": "Use these buttons to create a new user and remove the currently selected user. When creating a new user, you must specify a username, password, and level. Only give the user the highest necessary level - they don't need more access than is required.",
