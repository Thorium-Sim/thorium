# Contributing

Welcome to Thorium! Thorium is currently in Beta status, so there is still a lot
to be done.

_This contributing document borrows heavily from contributing docs by the
venerable [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds)._

## Requesting Features

- File an [issue](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). Issues are for
  bug reports, feature requests, and anything in between. If there is something
  you want done, file an issue!
- If you don't understand what an issue means, write a comment with your
  question and someone will explain in more detail.
- Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2) to
  know what features are coming and when they are coming.
- Read up on how Thorium works in the [docs](https://thoriumsim.com)

## Project Setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  `npm install`
3.  Create a branch from `develop` for your PR

> Tip: Keep your `develop` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/thorium-sim/thorium.git
> git fetch upstream
> git checkout -b develop
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/develop develop
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `develop`
> branch to use the upstream develop branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then
> you can make all of your pull request branches based on this `develop` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `develop`, do a regular
> `git pull`.

Then write some code and file a
[pull request](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/pulls). A handful of
issues are labeled
[Help Wanted](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
and are a good place to start.

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors][all-contributors] specification. To
add yourself to the table of contributors on the `README.md`, please use the
automated script as part of your PR:

```console
npm run add-contributor
```

Follow the prompt and commit `.all-contributorsrc` and `README.md` in the PR. If
you've already added yourself to the list and are making a new type of
contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution type.

Once you are a contributor to Thorium, you'll be added to the Github
organization. This will allow you to assign yourself to issues and merge
requests and will give you the 'Thorium-Sim' badge on your Github Profile.

## Pull Request Guidelines

All pull requests and issues are welcome, with the following requirements:

- Pull requests should branch from `develop` and target the `develop` branch,
  following the git-flow pattern. Releases will be merged into `master` and
  released at least weekly from the changes in the `develop` branch.
- Unless the pull request is a small one-off feature or bug fix, the pull
  request should reference an issue. If you are intending to start working on a
  new feature for some period of time, let me know first. This helps me make
  sure I don't work on something which you are already working on. If an issue
  exists, comment on it saying that you are working on it. If an issue doesn't
  exist, create one and add a comment saying you intend to implement the change.
- Any new pull requests will not be accepted unless a corresponding issue or
  pull request from [thorium-docs](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium-docs)
  is referenced, within reason. Some things don't need to be documented, but if
  there is any reason for docs to be created or updated, this will be a hard
  requirement.
